+ ### Non-Conservatively Defensive Strategy with Searching Based Motion Planner for On-Road Autonomous Driving (*May/2019 - Nov/2019*)
#### *Advised by Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka, Mechanical Systems Control Lab, University of California, Berkeley*

   + Realized the A* search based rough motion planner and optimization smoothing program on real autonomous driving experiment.
     
   + Applied the spatially-partitioned environmental representation and planning architecture in multiple obstacles urban environment.
     
   + Achieved successful obstacle avoidance including car and pedestrian on roundabout environment.
     
   + Combined non-conservatively defensive strategy with spatially-partitioned environmental representation and planning architecture in multiple obstacles urban environment.
     
+ ### Real Time Experiment Structure of Self Driving Car (*Jan/2019 - May/2019*)
#### *Advised by Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka, Mechanical Systems Control Lab, University of California, Berkeley*

   + Applied the Lanelet based locating method for autonomous driving in experiment area.

   + Constructed wireless internet connection for autonomous driving in experiment area.
     
   + Built up the message communication program structure for sim-car and real car based on ROS and RpcLib.
     
   + Generalized an experiment program structure for all planner.
     
+ ### Erhu Auto-Player (*Feb/2019 - May/2019*)

   + Designed the timing belt system with linear guide rail and sliding block for movements of finger.
     
   + Designed the music information represent system for the Erhu Auto-Player program.
     
   + Designed the up-layer program based on ROS to control the whole system playing music.
